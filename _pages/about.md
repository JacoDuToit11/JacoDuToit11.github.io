I am a computer scientist from Cape Town, South Africa. I am currently working as a Data Scientist/Machine Learning Engineer and independent AI safety researcher. 

I am excited by the rapid advancements in AI systems, but concerned about the catastrophic risks they may pose. Therefore, I am passionate about exploring AI safety, interpretability, and alignment in my future research to ensure that AI benefits all humanity.

## Background and History
I did my Master's in Computer Science at Stellenbosch University under Marcel Dunaiski. My thesis focused on transformer-based language models for natural language processing tasks. Before that I studied Mathematics and Computer Science at Stellenbosch University.  

## Other Interests
Apart from working on AI, I enjoy:
