I am a computer scientist from Cape Town, South Africa. I am currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer and independent AI safety researcher. 

I am excited by the rapid advancements in AI systems, but concerned about the catastrophic risks they may pose. Therefore, I am passionate about exploring AI safety, interpretability, and alignment in my future research to ensure that AI benefits all humanity.
